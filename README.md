# Laravel Project Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the Laravel project using Laravel Sail, migrate the database, and seed initial data.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project
Copy the .env.example file to .env:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Start the Laravel Sail containers:

    ```bash
    Copy code
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
Install PHP dependencies:

bash
Copy code
    ```./vendor/bin/sail composer install
Generate the application key:

bash
Copy code
    ```./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
Access the application at http://localhost

Database Migration and Seeding
Migrate the database:

bash
Copy code
    ```./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
Seed the database:

bash
Copy code
    ```./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed
Additional Notes
If you want to refresh the database with new migrations and seed data:

bash
Copy code
    ```./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:refresh --seed
To stop the Sail containers:

bash
Copy code
    ```./vendor/bin/sail down
You can customize the .env file with your database credentials, application settings, and more.



Replace `your-username` and `your-project` with your actual GitHub username and project name. Additionally, make sure to update any links, email addresses, and other placeholders according to your project's specifics.
